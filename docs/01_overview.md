# VR Cricket Simulator — Project Overview

This project is a full VR cricket simulation built using Unity, Arduino, and the MPU6050 sensor.  
It combines **virtual reality**, **physics-based cricket mechanics**, **AI fielding**, **motion tracking**, and a **hardware-driven bat controller**.

## Core Features
- Real-time bat tracking using MPU6050 + Arduino
- Head tracking via smartphone gyroscope
- Gaze-based UI interaction (no controllers needed)
- Physically simulated batting system
- Scripted pacer bowling animation
- AI fielders that chase, catch, and throw the ball
- Scoring, overs, wickets, and match logic
- VR-ready camera system for phone-based VR headsets

## Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- Hardware-software integration
- IMU-based motion tracking
- Realtime input in VR environments
- Game physics for sports simulation
- AI movement and behavior logic
- VR UI design via gaze interaction
